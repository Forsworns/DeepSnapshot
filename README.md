### Part of the source codes for my bachelor graduation thesis in SJTU.

- Implemented in Pytorch 1.2.0
- Only support RNN structures, implement a single cell and make up a full rnn 
- implement several optimization algorithms (including a plain connection)
- Splited to different modules, easy to add new net structures, optimization algorithms 
- enable `--poor` cofiguration item if your GPU owning limited memory
